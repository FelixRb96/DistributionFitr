Current Package: TauStar	Number of families: 3 
Current Family: DisHoeffInd 
Could not find a set of valid default values for family TauStarDisHoeffInd
Errors: either probs1 or probs2 in rDisHoeffInd is not a probability vector.
 since length(probs1) == 1 or length(probs2) == 1 resulting distribution is degenerate and thus has no density.

Current Family: HoeffInd 
Error occured for family HoeffInd
Error in all_params[[param]]: attempt to select less than one element in get1index


Current Family: MixHoeffInd 
Could not find a set of valid default values for family TauStarMixHoeffInd
Errors: probs in rMixHoeffInd is not a probability vector.
 probs represents a degenerate discrete random variable and thus the density of the asymptotic distribution doesn't exist

list()
Done.
