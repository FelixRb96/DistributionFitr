****************** first time help - begin *****************
Hello new user! Let me be the first to welcome you to P2BAT!
This is a one-time startup message intended to help you 
setup pbatR on your machine.  To see this again, just enter 
the command 'pbat.firsttime()' anytime.

For analysis purposes, first ensure that you have been to
  http://www.biostat.harvard.edu/~clange/default.htm
and have accepted the PBAT license, downloaded PBAT to your 
computer, and extracted PBAT somewhere. Make a note of this 
location, you will need to set this in this location in 
this software.
[LINUX SPECIAL NOTE: if you downloaded the linux version, 
you also need the pbatdata.txt which does not seem to be 
supplied with this - go ahead and get the windows version 
as well and take this file from there and put it in this 
location. Also, the current version posted is a 64bit 
version only for linux, and will not run on 32bit linux.]

Now, either start up the GUI with the R command:
  pbat()
AND
make sure you set the executable to the pbat file you 
downloaded (it is the first option in the GUI).

OR

If you are on you are on your local machine, run:
 library( tcltk )
 pbat.set()

OR

Run 
 pbat.set( "path.to.your.pbat" ).
Note that with this method in windows, use '\\' to separate 
directories rather than a single '\', i.e. 
'C:\\apps\\pbat', or just use the forward slash, i.e. 
'C:/apps/pbat'.

Please also try the R command
 pbat.help()
if you are having any problems.

You may wish to also check the P2BAT page at
 http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~tjhoffm/pbatR.html

Lastly, to start the power GUI, enter for continuous/binary
 pbat.power()
 pbat.power("dichotomous")
